# Number-Plate-Recognition
Automatic license plate recognition systems play a major role in a number of safety-related applications. They are used to identify given vehicles quickly and reliably, without disrupting the trac. Applications are far from being limited to
fight against crime: license plate recognition systems find their place wherever access is restricted to a type or category of vehicle

# Project presentation
In this report, we tried to develop a system for the detection and recognition of the identity of a moving vehicle (via its registration number), which operates on
images of cars taken from different perspectives and points of view. The problem of vehicle identification by automatic means is a real challenge and brings together a large number of difficulties. Indeed, where, for the human eye and brain, things are simple, by means of artificial vision coupled with powerful means of calculation,
everything remains complex.

# context
The registration number is an effective means of identifying vehicles. This is unique information for each car.
Frequently, it is necessary to identify vehicle license plates for safety. The information extracted can be used for several purposes, such as access and flow control, monitoring border crossings and tolls, searching for vehicles.
suspects or the fight against crime, etc. This makes their reading crucial and inevitable in all of these areas.
